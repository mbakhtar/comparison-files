## Step 1 @showdialog
Welcome to Power Storage for Wind Power Coding Tutorial.

## Step 2 @showdialog
In this coding tutorial use the LED light to indicate the level of 'charge' the wind turbine's battery has 
based on how fast the wind turbine is spinning. The faster it's spinning, the 
higher the charge. The wind turbine should move in the same direction as the 
dial is being turned, and use the button function to stop. When the wind turbine
is not moving, and therefore not generating power, the battery is considered 'dead'
and should not display any lights.

## Step 3 @showdialog
Turn on the the Climate Action Kit board.

## Step 4 @showhint
Click three dots besides ``|Download|`` button and follow the steps to pair your @boardname@.

## Step 5 @showhint
Click the ``|Download|`` button to download the blank project to intialize the 
simulators.

## Step 6 @showhint
Look below the @boardname@ simulator to see the Climate Action Board's simulator of the connected components.
- Try to interact with your sensor and the simulator will react to it.

## Step 7 @showhint
``|Download|`` and test your code. Click the bulb icon to see how 
the simulator shows the components working.
Congratulations on completing your project! - Go back to the lesson for more activities and extensions.
